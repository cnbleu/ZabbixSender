Zabbix Sender

ZABBIX Sender is an application for testing the connection to a Zabbix server. The app sends the keys and its values in JSON format and it's waiting for a response. The algorithm is taken from Zabbix web site and the app is as the sender not the agent. Full instruction how to set Zabbix Sender and Server is in the app (Additional Info).
Check app at Google Play Store to make sure it does what you need.
The app has been tested via local wireless network only. Let me know if any problems with Mobile network.
I'm not a programmer, I just had a need to test Zabbix server and here source of my work.
